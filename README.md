# Water Potability Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Overview**

This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict the potability of water based on its physicochemical properties. Using a Random Forest Classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset, the system evaluates parameters like pH, hardness, turbidity, and others to determine whether water is potable or not. A user-friendly web interface, built with Flask, allows users to input water quality attributes and receive real-time predictions.
